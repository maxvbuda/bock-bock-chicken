      The Golden Knight of Chickenopolis
    </div>
    <div class="story">
      Long before his name was etched in golden letters on the walls of Chickenopolis, Sir Peepius Aurelius was
      simply Peep — the littlest chick of the Cluckington brood. While his father Roostwell defended the coop and
      his mother Henrietta baked muffins that could outlast a winter, Peep dreamed not of chores or festivals but of
      glory.<br><br>
      That glory arrived one spring morning, when the Cluckingtons hosted the legendary Egg-stravaganza Festival.
      Between muddy puddles, feather-fluffing races, and a wise riddle from Professor Featherbeak, young Peep
      stumbled upon the Golden Egg, hidden beneath the oldest oak tree in all of Chickenopolis. Lifting it high, he
      was crowned the hero of the day, his name cheered across the city.<br><br>
      But Peep hungered for more than a single triumph. He trained in the ways of discipline, inspired by the
      scrolls of the old Rooster Republic. He donned armor forged in the Roman style, carried the gladius of his
      forefathers, and bore a shield etched with the Golden Egg and laurel wreath — the eternal symbol of
      Cluckington victory.<br><br>
      When fox marauders swept into Chickenopolis years later, it was Sir Peepius Aurelius who led the defense.
      Standing at the city gates, he raised his shield high and cried:<br>
      <em>“As I once found the egg, I shall now guard the nest!”</em><br><br>
      With a cheer from the townsfolk, he drove the invaders back, proving himself not just the hero of a festival,
      but the champion of a city.<br><br>
      To this day, children of Chickenopolis race beneath the old oak tree, chanting his name, and knights of the
      city touch their shields to the Golden Egg before battle, whispering his vow:<br>
      <em>“In every egg lies a legacy — and in every Cluckington, a hero.”</em>
